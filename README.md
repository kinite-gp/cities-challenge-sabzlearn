# cities-challenge-sabzlearn


We have a file that contains the names of all the cities and their countries, and you should do this:

- From the placed file, you create a new file that is sorted alphabetically
- Next, the program asks the user for the name of a city and after searching in the new file, it says in which country the city is located
- You are not allowed to import any modules or libraries for this program
